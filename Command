Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
in config/environments/development.rb:

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
For example:

root to: "home#index"

3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
For example:

<p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
<p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
or load models when precompiling your assets.

5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

rails g devise:views
